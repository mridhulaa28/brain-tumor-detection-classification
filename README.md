__Brain Tumor Identification and Classification using Pre-Trained CNN - MobileNetV2__    
__Purpose:__  
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for accurate classification of brain tumors in MRI images. The classification task involves four main categories of brain tumors: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Accurate localization and categorization of brain tumors are crucial for effective medical interventions and improved patient outcomes.

__Overview:__  
__Objective:__ Develop a deep learning model for brain tumor classification in MRI images.  
__Method:__ Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 fine-tuned for classification task.  
__Dataset:__ Kaggle dataset with 3,264 MRI scans (2,870 for training, 394 for testing).  
__Evaluation:__ Model performance evaluated through metrics like accuracy, loss, and visualizations.  

__Results:__  
__Training Accuracy:__ 96%  
__Testing Accuracy:__ 88%  
__Model Performance:__ High classification accuracy for all tumor types.  

__Conclusion:__  
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning, specifically transfer learning with MobileNetV2, for brain tumor classification in MRI images. The model shows high accuracy in classifying different types of brain tumors, which can potentially improve diagnosis and treatment planning for neurological disorders. The code and trained model can be used for further research and applications in medical imaging.
